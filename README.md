# Trello_project4

The goal was to recreate a Trello, using both vu and a RestApi using Wordpress.
be able to create multiple tables which would contain Cards. We were unable to manage the drag n drop in time within the 5 days of development assuming we could implement it later. (Now we know...)

## My_work
